The {% include link elem="mSpace" %} (<span class="expan">measure space</span>) element is closely
related to the {% include link elem="space" %} and {% include link elem="mRest" %} elements. It
is used to explicitly indicate that a layer has no content but that no information
is
missing from the encoding.
