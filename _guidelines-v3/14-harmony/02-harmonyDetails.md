On the most basic level, chords in the musical text can be encoded using the 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/chord">chord</a> element:



<span class="specList">
   
   <span class="specDesc"></span>
   
</span>


Additional information on the use of the 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/chord">chord</a> element is available in

<span class="ptr"></span> and 
<span class="ptr"></span>.

With only this kind of markup, harmonic information is implicit in the notes themselves.
The
elements and attributes of this module, however, provide for the encoding of explicit
indications of harmony, such as chord symbols, tablature grids, figured bass signs,
and the
symbols of harmonic analysis like Roman numerals and their interpretation.
