   Most often, MEI is used for the preparation of a digital musical text based on an
   existing
   music document, or with the intention of rendering the encoded notation into a document
   or audio
   rendition. MEI can, however, be used to provide a different kind of digital reproduction
   of a
   source document, which relies on the description and provision of digital imagery.
   Both
   approaches may be combined, so that the encoding of the musical content and digital
   facsimiles
   may add different facets to the same MEI document.
