The following elements are used to indicate when single notational symbols have been
omitted
from, added to, or marked for deletion from, a musical text. Like the other editorial
elements
described in this chapter, they allow for a wide range of editorial practices:

{% include specDesc.html version=page.version elem="att.reasonident" atts="att.reasonident/reason" %}
