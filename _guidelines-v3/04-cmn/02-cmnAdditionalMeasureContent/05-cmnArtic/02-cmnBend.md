A bend is a variation in pitch (often microtonal) upwards or downwards during the
course
of a note. Typically, the performer attacks the note at ‘true’ pitch,
changes the intonation, then returns to true pitch. The [bend](/v3/elements/bend.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element
can also be used for so-called scoop, plop, falloff, and doit performance effects.
It
should <span class="hi">not</span> be used for laissez vibrer (l.v.) indications. As with
other control events, the starting point of the bend may be indicated by either a
tstamp,
tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify
a
starting attribute.
