title: "Breath Marks"

A breath mark indicates a point at which the performer of a wind instrument
or singer may breathe. It is sometimes also used to indicate a short pause or break
for
instruments <span class="hi">not</span> requiring breath, which allows it to also serve as
a guide to phrasing. In MEI, breath marks are encoded using the 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/breath">breath</a> element, which is a member of 
<a class="link_odd" href="/v3/model-classes/model.controleventLike">model.controleventLike</a>. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point
attribute.

The usual sign for the breath mark is a comma; however, other visual forms of the
breath
mark may be indicated using the **@altsym** attribute (see chapter 
<a class="link_ptr" title="User-defined Symbols" href="/v3/guidelines/userSymbols">22 User-defined Symbols</a> for further details).
