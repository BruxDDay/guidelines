Undoubtedly, the most important element for any music notation representation is the
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/note">note</a> element, which is defined in section 
<a class="link_ptr" title="Basic Music Events" href="/v3/guidelines/shared#sharedBasicEvents">1.2.3 Basic Music Events</a>. This section describes the usage of 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/note">note</a> in the CMN repertoire as well as CMN-specific additions to the basic
definition in the shared module.
