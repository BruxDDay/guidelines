Undoubtedly, the most important element for any music notation representation is the
[note](/v3/elements/note.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element, which is defined in section <a class="link_ptr" title="Basic Music Events" href="/v3/guidelines/shared.html#sharedBasicEvents">1.2.3 Basic Music Events</a>. This section describes the usage of [note](/v3/elements/note.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} in the CMN repertoire as well as CMN-specific additions to the basic
definition in the shared module.
