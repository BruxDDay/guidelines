The following elements are available for description of a composition's performing
forces:



{% include _specDesc.html key="perfMedium" atts="" %}
{% include _specDesc.html key="perfResList" atts="" %}
{% include _specDesc.html key="castList" atts="" %}



The <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/perfMedium">perfMedium</a> element provides the possibility of describing a work
in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required. In
the case
of a dramatic work, the dramatis personae and associated voice qualities may be enumerated
using 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/castList">castList</a>. The 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/perfResList">perfResList</a> element
describes the necessary instrumental and vocal resources.
