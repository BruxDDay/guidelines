title: "Performance Medium"
---



The following elements are available for description of a composition's performing
forces:



{% include specDesc.html key="perfMedium" atts="" %}
{% include specDesc.html key="perfResList" atts="" %}
{% include specDesc.html key="castList" atts="" %}



The [perfMedium](/v3/elements/perfMedium.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element provides the possibility of describing a work
in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required. In
the case
of a dramatic work, the dramatis personae and associated voice qualities may be enumerated
using [castList](/v3/elements/castList.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}. The [perfResList](/v3/elements/perfResList.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element
describes the necessary instrumental and vocal resources.
