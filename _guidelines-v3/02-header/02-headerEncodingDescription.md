The [encodingDesc](/{{ page.version }}/elements/encodingDesc.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element is the second major subdivision of the MEI
header. It specifies the methods and editorial principles which governed the transcription
or
encoding of the source material. Though not formally required, its use is highly
recommended.



{% include specDesc.html version=page.version key="encodingDesc" atts="" %}
