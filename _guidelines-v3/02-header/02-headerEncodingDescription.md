The <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/encodingDesc">encodingDesc</a> element is the second major subdivision of the MEI
header. It specifies the methods and editorial principles which governed the transcription
or
encoding of the source material. Though not formally required, its use is highly
recommended.



{% include _specDesc.html key="encodingDesc" atts="" %}



The encoding description may contain elements taken from the model.encodingPart class.

{% include _specDesc.html key="projectDesc" atts="" %}
