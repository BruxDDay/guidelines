   This chapter describes the use of attributes that capture data which may be useful
   for
   analytical purposes. The analysis module provides attributes that record relationships
   between
   entities found in the encoding. These attributes may be used differently by different
   users,
   depending on the purpose of the analysis. These Guidelines recommend that encoders
   employ
   commonly accepted analytical practices, such as "functional analysis" or "Schenkerian
   analysis",
   and document their use in the
