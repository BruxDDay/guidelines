title: "Ornaments in Combinations"
---



Particularly in baroque keyboard music, but also in the early classical period, various
combinations of ornaments can be found. Despite being written vertically above the
same note,
they are to be performed in sequence.

The following example from C.P.E. Bach's sonata W.62/1 shows a turn followed by a
inverted
mordent:

   <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 36. Example of multiple ornaments. From C.P.E. Bach's sonata W.62/1.</figcaption>
</figure>
When encoding the example above, both ornaments will be positioned above the same
note. The
encoded order of the elements, moreover, should correspond to the performed sequence,
which in
this example is top to bottom: first the turn, then the mordent.
