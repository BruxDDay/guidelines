   This chapter describes how to encode words and syllables in vocal notation. This text
   is
   typically written under a staff to indicate the text to be vocally performed. As such,
   this text
   should not be confused with other text on the score, for which see 
   <a class="link_ptr" title="Shared Textual Elements" href="/v3/guidelines/shared.html#sharedTextualElements">1.3 Shared Textual Elements</a> and 
   <a class="link_ptr" title="Text in MEI" href="/v3/guidelines/text.html">21 Text in MEI</a>
   
   
   These guidelines suggest two methods for encoding text in vocal notation: encoding
   syllables
   [under each note](/v3/guidelines/lyricsDesc.html#lyricsInEvents "Vocally Performed
   Text Encoded Within Notes"){:.link_ref} and encoding performed text [after the notes](/v3/guidelines/lyricsDesc.html#lyricsAfterEvents
   "Vocally Performed Text Encoded Separately"){:.link_ref} (and other staff events)
   either within [layer](/v3/elements/layer.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} elements or
   within [measure](/v3/elements/measure.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} elements when
   available (for example in a Common Music Notation context). Each method may be more
   convenient
   depending on the source text and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends
   to
   record.
   
   
   Both methods eventually rely on the [syl](/v3/elements/syl.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}
   element, which is part of the
   ‘shared’ module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following
   sections will begin by introducing the general use of [syl](/v3/elements/syl.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}
   and then show in
   detail the two different encoding methods.
