   </h1>
   This chapter describes how to encode words and syllables in vocal notation. This text
   is
   typically written under a staff to indicate the text to be vocally performed. As such,
   this text
   should not be confused with other text on the score, for which see 
   <span class="ptr"></span> and 
   <span class="ptr"></span>
   
   
   These guidelines suggest two methods for encoding text in vocal notation: encoding
   syllables
   
   <span class="ref">under each note</span> and encoding performed text 
   <span class="ref">after the notes</span> (and other staff events) either within 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/layer">layer</a> elements or within 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/measure">measure</a> elements when
   available (for example in a Common Music Notation context). Each method may be more
   convenient
   depending on the source text and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends
   to
   record.
   
   
   <!-- TODO: Check if <syl> belongs here or in the shared chapter (#lyricSyllables). Writing here for now! -->
   Both methods eventually rely on the 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/syl">syl</a> element, which is part of the
   ‘shared’ module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following
   sections will begin by introducing the general use of 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/syl">syl</a> and then show in
   detail the two different encoding methods.
