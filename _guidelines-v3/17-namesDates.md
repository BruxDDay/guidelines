   This chapter describes the MEI module used for the encoding of names (names of persons
   or
   corporations/organizations) or descriptive phrases for styles, periods or geographical
   indications. In section 
   <a class="link_ptr" title="Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses" href="/v3/guidelines/shared.html#sharedNamesNumbersDates">1.3.4 Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses</a> it was noted that the elements
   provided in the core module allow an encoder to specify that a given text segment
   is a proper
   noun. The elements provided by the present module allow the encoder to supply a detailed
   sub-structure for such proper nouns, and to distinguish explicitly between persons
   and
   organizations, and between stylistic, periodical or geographical indications.
   
   The chapter begins by discussing the elements provided for the encoding of names ([name](/v3/elements/name.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec})
   and dates ([date](/v3/elements/date.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}) in general and
   finishes by
   addressing more specific elements for corporate names ([corpName](/v3/elements/corpName.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}),
   geographic names ([geogName](/v3/elements/geogName.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}),
   period names ([periodName](/v3/elements/periodName.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}),
   personal names ([persName](/v3/elements/persName.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}) and
   style names ([styleName](/v3/elements/styleName.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}). In
   general it is recommended to use standardized forms of proper
   nouns and to record the names and web-accessible locations of the controlled vocabularies
   used.
   There are several commonly-referenced authority files, especially for geographical,
   organizational and personal names, such as the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND), the Library
   of
   Congress Authorities, the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and the MARC
   code list for
   relators. Recommendations on which standards could be used can be found in the descriptions
   of
   the individual elements.
