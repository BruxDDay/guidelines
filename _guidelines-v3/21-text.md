   This chapter describes methods for encoding textual content with MEI. Textual information
   on
   scores has several different uses, although some text is closer to music notation
   than other
   kinds. For example, tempo marks, directives and lyrics are directly related to the
   functionality
   of the notated music and are, therefore, described in other chapters (see for example
   
   <a class="link_ptr" title="Vocal Text" href="/v3/guidelines/lyricsDesc.html">15 Vocal Text</a> and 
   <a class="link_ptr" title="Text Directives" href="/v3/guidelines/shared.html#sharedTextDirectives">1.2.5.1 Text Directives</a>). This chapter, on the other
   hand, focuses on the text that accompanies the score, i.e., paratext (prefatory material,
   title
   pages, back matter, appendices, etc.), titles, prose, poetry, etc.
   
   Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal
   primarily
   with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). These elements are
   provided to
   encode relatively basic textual information. For deeper encoding of text, these Guidelines
   recommend consideration of other text-specific encoding formats with embedded MEI
   markup.
