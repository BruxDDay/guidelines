   <span class="head">Recommendations for the Encoding of Large Corpora</span>
</h2>
These Guidelines include proposals for the identification and encoding of a far greater
variety of textual features and characteristics than is likely to be either feasible
or
desirable in any one corpus, however large and ambitious. For most large-scale corpus
projects, it will therefore be necessary to determine a subset of recommended elements
appropriate to the anticipated needs of the
project
<!--, as further discussed in chapter <ptr
        target="#"/>-->
<!--TODO: add reference to chapter on customization -->;
these mechanisms include the ability to exclude selected element types, add new element
types,
and change the names of existing elements.

Because of the high cost of identifying and encoding many textual features, and the
difficulty in ensuring consistent practice across very large corpora, encoders may
find it
convenient to divide the set of elements to be encoded into the following four categories:

<span class="list">
   
   <span class="label">required</span>
   
   <span class="item"> - texts included within the corpus will always encode textual features in this
      category, should they exist in the text
   </span>
   
   <span class="label">recommended</span>
   
   <span class="item"> - textual features in this category will be encoded wherever economically and
      practically feasible; where present but not encoded, a note in the header should be
      made.
   </span>
   
   <span class="label">optional</span>
   
   <span class="item"> - textual features in this category may or may not be encoded; no conclusion about
      the absence of such features can be inferred from the absence of the corresponding
      element
      in a given text.
   </span>
   
   <span class="label">proscribed</span>
   
   <span class="item"> - textual features in this category are deliberately not encoded; they may be
      transcribed as unmarked up text, or represented as 
      <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/gap">gap</a> elements, or
      silently omitted, as appropriate.
