         <td>JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group</td>
         <td> - This format is sponsored by CCITT and by ISO. It is ISO/IEC Draft International
            Standard 10918-1, and CCITT T.81. It handles monochrome and polychromatic images with
            a
            variety of compression techniques. JPEG per se, like CCITT Group IV, must be
            encapsulated before transmission; this can be done via TIFF, or via the JPEG File
            Interchange Format (JFIF), as commonly done for Internet delivery.

         <td>Photo-CD: Kodak Photo Compact Disk format</td>
         <td> - This format was introduced by Kodak for rasterizing photographs and storing them
            on CD-ROMs (about one hundred 35mm file images fit on one disk), for display on
            televisions or CD-I systems. Information on Photo-CD is available from Kodak Limited,
            Research and Development, Headstone Drive, Harrow, Middlesex HA1 4TY, UK.
