Because they can occur in the context of a stream of events on the staff, some elements
which are used in other contexts are also treated as events. For example, in addition
to
being used to define the initial clef of a staff, the [clef](/v3/elements/clef.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element can
also be used to indicate a clef change.
