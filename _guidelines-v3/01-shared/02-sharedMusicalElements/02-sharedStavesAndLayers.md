The elements below are used to capture the logical organization of musical notation:



{% include specDesc.html key="staff" atts="" %}
{% include specDesc.html key="layer" atts="" %}



The actual use of the [staff](/v3/elements/staff.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} and [layer](/v3/elements/layer.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} elements
depends on the repertoire and historical context of the source material. For details
on
their use in Common Western Notation, please refer to chapter <a class="link_ptr" title="The Role of the Measure Element" href="/v3/guidelines/cmn.html#cmnMeasures">4.1.1 The Role of the Measure Element</a>.
For mensural notation, see chapter 
<a class="link_ptr" title="Music Data Organization" href="/v3/guidelines/mensural.html#mensuralData">5.5 Music Data Organization</a>, and for neumatic notation,
chapter 
<a class="link_ptr" title="Neume Notation" href="/v3/guidelines/neumes.html">6 Neume Notation</a>.
