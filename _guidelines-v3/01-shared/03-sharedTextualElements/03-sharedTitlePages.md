title: "Transcription of Titlepages"

A specialized element is furnished for the capture of titlepage information.



{% include specDesc.html key="titlePage" atts="" %}



The [titlePage](/v3/elements/titlePage.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element, modelled after a similar element in Encoded
Archival Description (EAD), may occur within the textual matter preceding or following
the
musical content of the encoding. Since a diplomatic transcription of the titlepage
is often
necessary to accurately identify musical material contained within a source, [titlePage](/v3/elements/titlePage.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} may also be used within the metadata header as a child of the
[physDesc](/v3/elements/physDesc.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element.
