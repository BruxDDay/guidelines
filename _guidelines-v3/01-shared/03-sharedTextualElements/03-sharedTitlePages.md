A specialized element is furnished for the capture of titlepage information.



{% include _specDesc.html key="titlePage" atts="" %}



The <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/titlePage">titlePage</a> element, modelled after a similar element in Encoded
Archival Description (EAD), may occur within the textual matter preceding or following
the
musical content of the encoding. Since a diplomatic transcription of the titlepage
is often
necessary to accurately identify musical material contained within a source, 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/titlePage">titlePage</a> may also be used within the metadata header as a child of the

<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/physDesc">physDesc</a> element.
