A paragraph is a structural unit of a larger text. Usually, it is typographically
distinct;
that is, it usually begins on a new line and the first letter of the content is often
indented, enlarged, or both. This element has a similar meaning as the corresponding
elements in Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and
HTML.



{% include specDesc.html key="p" atts="" %}



In MEI, a [p](/v3/elements/p.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} is used in many different situations, including
transcriptional use within a [titlePage](/v3/elements/titlePage.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} or descriptive purposes as in a
[changeDesc](/v3/elements/changeDesc.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}.
