Proportions can also be indicated within the [staffDef]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/elements/staffDef.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element. The
**@num** and **@numbase** attributes are available for encoding the numerator
and the denominator of the proportion respectively. There is also a [proport]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/elements/proport.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element that can be used as an alternative.
