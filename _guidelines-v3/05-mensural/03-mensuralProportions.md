Proportions can also be indicated within the <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/staffDef">staffDef</a> element. The
**@num** and **@numbase** attributes are available for encoding the numerator
and the denominator of the proportion respectively. There is also a 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/proport">proport</a> element that can be used as an alternative.
