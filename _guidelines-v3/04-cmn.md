   The module described in this chapter offers the means to describe music in so-called
   ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN, sometimes referred to as
   ‘Common Western Music Notation’). For this purpose, it provides a number of
   special elements and adds several attribute classes to elements from the 
   <a class="link_ref" title="Shared Elements, Models, and Attributes" href="/v3/guidelines/shared">Shared</a> module.
