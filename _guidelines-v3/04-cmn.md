   The module described in this chapter offers the means to describe music in so-called
   ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN, sometimes referred to as
   ‘Common Western Music Notation’). For this purpose, it provides a number of
   special elements and adds several attribute classes to elements from the [Shared](/v3/guidelines/shared.html
   "Shared Elements, Models, and Attributes"){:.link_ref} module.
