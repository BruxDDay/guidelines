title: "Uses of the Usersymbols Module"
---



 The elements provided by the usersymbols module may be used in two ways: 1. For defining lines, curves and text elements that cannot be represented by a more
specific element.2. For defining reusable symbols and special graphical renditions.
For this purpose, it provides three elements as graphic primitives, [line](/v3/elements/line.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}, [curve](/v3/elements/curve.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} and [anchoredText](/v3/elements/anchoredText.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}. Anywhere
these elements are allowed, the [symbol](/v3/elements/symbol.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element can be used as well. The
[symbol](/v3/elements/symbol.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element facilitates the re-use of symbols that were defined by
[symbolDef](/v3/elements/symbolDef.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} elements.
