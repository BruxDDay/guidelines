It is common, in many types of texts, to find quotations. A quotation is typically
attributed
to another text other than the one being encoded. Often, the quoted material is
typographically distinct from the surrounding text; i.e., surrounded by so-called
‘quote marks’ or rendered as a separate block of text. The [quote](/v3/elements/quote.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element is used to mark this function:



{% include specDesc.html key="quote" atts="" %}



The following examples show the use of [quote](/v3/elements/quote.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec}.

{% include plainExample.html example="./v3/examples/text/text-sample335.xml" valid="true" %}


{% include plainExample.html example="./v3/examples/text/text-sample336.xml" valid="true" %}
