It is common, in many types of texts, to find quotations. A quotation is typically
attributed
to another text other than the one being encoded. Often, the quoted material is
typographically distinct from the surrounding text; i.e., surrounded by so-called
‘quote marks’ or rendered as a separate block of text. The {% include link elem="quote" %} element is used to mark this function:



{% include desc elem="quote" %}




The following examples show the use of {% include link elem="quote" %}.

{% include plainExample.html example="examples/text/text-sample335.xml" valid="true" version=page.version %}
{% include plainExample.html example="examples/text/text-sample336.xml" valid="true" version=page.version %}
