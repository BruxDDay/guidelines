In the case of neume notation where no absolute pitch is indicated, you may use the
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/supplied">supplied</a> element to indicate an editorially-added pitch. This element's
**@source** attribute may be used to supply a reference to a source with the
absolute pitch provided.
