In the case of neume notation where no absolute pitch is indicated, you may use the
[supplied](/v3/elements/supplied.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element to indicate an editorially-added pitch. This element's
**@source** attribute may be used to supply a reference to a source with the
absolute pitch provided.
