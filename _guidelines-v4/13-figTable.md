Apart from music and text, musical documents, both historical and contemporary, may
also
contain material in graphical or tabular format. In such materials, details of layout
and
presentation may also be of comparatively greater significance or complexity than
they are for
running text. Although some types of graphical material can be represented directly
with markup,
it is more common practice to include such information by using a reference to an
external
entity (typically a URL) encoded in a suitable graphical format.

The module defined by this chapter defines special purpose ‘container’
elements that can be used to encapsulate occurrences of such data within an MEI-conformant
document in a portable way. Specific recommendations for the encoding of figures,
figure
descriptions and graphics as well as tables with their sub-elements [tr]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/elements/tr.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec},
[td]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/elements/td.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} and [th]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/elements/th.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} are provided at the beginnig of this
chapter. As there exists a wide variety of different graphic formats, a short list
of formats
that are widely used at the present time, is given in section <a class="link_ptr" title="Images" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/guidelines/figTable.html#figTableImages">13.1.2 Images</a>.
Each one includes a very brief description. The chapter closes with attribute and
model classes
which are defined by the module.

The module described in this chapter makes available the following components:
