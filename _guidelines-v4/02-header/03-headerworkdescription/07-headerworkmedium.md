The following elements are available for description of a composition's performing
forces:



{% include desc elem="perfmedium" %}
{% include desc elem="perfreslist" %}
{% include desc elem="castlist" %}




The {% include link elem="perfmedium" %} element provides the possibility of describing a work
in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required. In
the case
of a dramatic work, the dramatis personae and associated voice qualities may be enumerated
using {% include link elem="castlist" %}. The {% include link elem="perfreslist" %} element
describes the necessary instrumental and vocal resources.
