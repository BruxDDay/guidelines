{% include specDesc.html version=page.version elem="projectDesc" atts="" %}



The [projectDesc]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.version }}/elements/projectDesc.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element may be used to describe, in prose, the
purpose for which a digital resource was created, together with any other relevant
information concerning the process by which it was assembled or collected. This is
of
particular importance for corpora or miscellaneous collections, but may be of use
for any
text, for example to explain why one kind of encoding practice has been followed rather
than
another.

For example:

{% include plainExample.html example="examples/header/header-sample050.xml" valid="true" version=page.version %}
