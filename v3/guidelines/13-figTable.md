   Apart from music and text, musical documents, both historical and contemporary, may
   also
   contain material in graphical or tabular format. In such materials, details of layout
   and
   presentation may also be of comparatively greater significance or complexity than
   they are for
   running text. Although some types of graphical material can be represented directly
   with markup,
   it is more common practice to include such information by using a reference to an
   external
   entity (typically a URL) encoded in a suitable graphical format.
   
   The module defined by this chapter defines special purpose ‘container’
   elements that can be used to encapsulate occurrences of such data within an MEI-conformant
   document in a portable way. Specific recommendations for the encoding of figures,
   figure
   descriptions and graphics as well as tables with their sub-elements 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/tr">tr</a>,
   
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/td">td</a> and 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/th">th</a> are provided at the beginnig of this
   chapter. As there exists a wide variety of different graphic formats, a short list
   of formats
   that are widely used at the present time, is given in section 
   <span class="ptr"></span>.
   Each one includes a very brief description. The chapter closes with attribute and
   model classes
   which are defined by the module.
   
   The module described in this chapter makes available the following components:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <!--<div type="div2" xml:id="figTableAttributeClasses">
    <head>Attribute Classes</head>
    <p>The module figTable defines the att.tabular attribute class which groups attributes shared by table cells:</p>
    <p>
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="att.tabular" atts="rowspan colspan"/>
      </specList>

    <div type="div3" xml:id="figTableModelFigDescLike">
      <head>model.figDescLike</head>
      <p>The model class model.figDescLike groups elements that provide a brief prose description of
        the appearance or content of a graphic figure.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="figTableModelFigureLike">
      <head>model.figureLike</head>
      <p>The model class model.figureLike groups elements representing or containing graphic
        information such as an illustration or figure.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="figTableModelGraphicLike">
      <head>model.graphicLike</head>
      <p>The model class model.graphicLike groups elements that indicate the location of an inline
        graphic, illustration, or figure.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="figTableModelTableLike">
      <head>model.tableLike</head>
      <p>The model class model.tableLike groups table-like elements.</p>
