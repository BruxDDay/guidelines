   This chapter describes the encoding of indications of harmony ocurring within a music
   text,
   e.g., chord names, tablature grids, figured bass, or signs for harmonic analysis,
   and the
   methods by which these indications can be connected with their interpretations. For
   encoder-supplied analysis of intervallic content, please see chapter
