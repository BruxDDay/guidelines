Neume encoding in MEI was initially developed as part of the Hildegard von Bingen
project at
the University of T체bingen. MEI was chosen as the basic representation format after
a 
<span class="ref">comparison of existing
   music encoding formats
</span>. The initial work on this module was performed by Gregor
Schr채der 
<span class="ref">(Ein
   XML-Datenformat zur Repr채sentation kritischer Musikedition unter besonderer Ber체cksichtigung
   von Neumennotation)
</span>, supervised by Prof. Stefan Morent. 

This module was originally developed against version 1.8 of the MEI DTD, and has subsequently
been translated to the TEI ODD schema.
