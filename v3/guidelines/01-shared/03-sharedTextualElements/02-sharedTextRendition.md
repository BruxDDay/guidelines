Sometimes, it is desirable to capture the typographical qualities of a word or phrase
without assigning it a special meaning. For this purpose, MEI offers the 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/rend">rend</a> element, similar to TEI's 
<span class="foreign">hi</span> element. Using CSS-like values,
its **@rend** attribute can be used to specify many typographic features, such as font
style, font variants, and relative font size and weight. In addition, text decoration,
direction, and enclosing ‘boxes’ may be captured. While **@rend**
is used to record relative font size and weight, absolute values for these qualities
(measured in printers points) should be specified using the **@fontsize** and
**@fontweight** attibutes. In addition to commonly found typographical qualities,
MEI provides the **@altrend** attribute for the capture of additional, user-defined
rendition information.
