   This chapter describes how to encode differences between multiple exemplars of the
   same musical
   work (often referred to in MEI as ‘sources’). The mechanisms and elements
   described in this chapter are closely related to their counterparts in the TEI guidelines.
   It is
   also important to refer to chapter 
   <span class="ptr"></span> of these guidelines, especially
   concerning the 
   <a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/choice">choice</a> element described therein.
