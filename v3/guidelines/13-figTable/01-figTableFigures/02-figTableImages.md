The 
<a class="link_odd_elementSpec" href="/v3/elements/graphic">graphic</a> element indicates the location of an inline graphic,
illustration, or figure. As noted above, there exists a wide variety of different
graphics
formats, and the following list is in no way exhaustive. Moreover, inclusion of any
format
in this list should not be taken as indicating endorsement by the MEI of this format
or any
products associated with it. Some of the formats listed here are proprietary to a
greater or
lesser extent and cannot therefore be regarded as standards in any meaningful sense.
They
are, however, widely used by many different vendors. The following formats are widely
used
at the present time, and are likely to remain supported by more than one vendor's
software:

   <span class="item">JPEG: Joint Photographic Expert Group</span>

Brief descriptions of all the above are given below. Where possible, current addresses
or
other contact information are shown for the originator of each format. Many formal
standards, especially those promulgated by the ISO and many related national organizations
(ANSI, DIN, BSI, and many more), are available from those national organizations.
Addresses
may be found in any standard organizational directory for the country in question.
