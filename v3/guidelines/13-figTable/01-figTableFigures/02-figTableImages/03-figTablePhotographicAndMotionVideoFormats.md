   <span class="label">JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group</span>
   
   <span class="item"> - This format is sponsored by CCITT and by ISO. It is ISO/IEC Draft International
      Standard 10918-1, and CCITT T.81. It handles monochrome and polychromatic images with
      a
      variety of compression techniques. JPEG per se, like CCITT Group IV, must be
      encapsulated before transmission; this can be done via TIFF, or via the JPEG File
      Interchange Format (JFIF), as commonly done for Internet delivery.

   <!-- <label>QuickTime: Apple real-time image system</label>
            <item>QuickTime is a proprietary method introduced by Apple Computer Company to
              synchronize the display of various data. The data can include frames of video, sound,
              lighting control mechanisms, and other things. Viewers for QuickTime productions are
              available for Apple and other computers. Further information is available from Apple
              Computer Incorporated, 10201 North de Anza Boulevard MS 23AQ, Cupertino, California
              95014 USA.</item>-->
   
   <span class="label">Photo-CD: Kodak Photo Compact Disk format</span>
   
   <span class="item"> - This format was introduced by Kodak for rasterizing photographs and storing them
      on CD-ROMs (about one hundred 35mm file images fit on one disk), for display on
      televisions or CD-I systems. Information on Photo-CD is available from Kodak Limited,
      Research and Development, Headstone Drive, Harrow, Middlesex HA1 4TY, UK.

   <!--<label>SMIL: Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language format</label>
            <item>SMIL is a W3C Recommendation which supports the integration of independent
              multimedia objects into a synchronized multimedia presentation. It provides multimedia
              authors with easily-defined basic timing relationships, fine-tuned synchronization,
              spatial layout, direct inclusion of non-text and non-image media objects, hyperlink
              support for time-based media, adaptiveness to varying user and system characteristics.
              SMIL 1.0 (<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/"/>) became a W3C Recommendation
              on June 15, 1998, and was further developed in SMIL 2.0. SMIL 2.0 adds native support
              for transitions, animation, event-based interaction, extended layout facilities, and
              more sophisticated timing and synchronization primitives to the SMIL 1.0 language. It
              also allows reuse of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based languages, in
              particular those who need to represent timing and synchronization. For example, SMIL
              2.0 components are used for integrating timing into XHTML Document Types and into SVG.
              SMIL 2.0 also provides recommendations for Document Types based on SMIL 2.0 Modules
                (<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-modules.html"/>). One such Document
              Type is the SMIL 2.0 Language Profile (<ref
                target="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil20-profile.html"/>). It contains support for
              all of the major SMIL 2.0 features including animation, content control, layout,
              linking, media object, meta-information, structure, timing, and transition effects and
              is designed for Web clients that support direct playback from SMIL 2.0 markup. SMIL
              2.0 (<ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/"/>) became a W3C Recommendation on
              August 7, 2001, becoming the first vocabulary to provide XML Schema support and to
              have reached such status.</item>-->
