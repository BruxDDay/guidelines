   MEI header information may refer to different levels of description of the encoded
   work: Some
   information may apply the work in all its various forms and realizations, e.g., the
   name of its
   composer. Other information may describe a certain version of the work, or a source
   such as the
   printed first edition, or only a single copy of that source. Core MEI limits the header
   information to two such levels of description: work and source, respectively.
   
   However, when the FRBR module is available more detailed descriptions are possible.
   With
   certain limitations, mainly due to the musical nature of the works encoded in MEI,
   the FRBR
   module adapts the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) as recommended
   by the
   International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) [
   <span class="ref">http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records</span>].
   
   The IFLAâ€™s FRBR model distinguishes four levels of abstraction, or entities:
   
   
   <span class="list">
      
      <span class="label">Work</span>
      
      <span class="item">FRBR defines a work as a "distinct intellectual or artistic creation", an abstract
         entity because there is no single material object one can point to as the work.
      </span>
      
      <span class="label">Expression</span>
      
      <span class="item">An expression is defined as "the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in
         the
         form of [...] notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of
         such
         forms". Expressions are also abstract entities.
      </span>
      
      <span class="label">Manifestation</span>
      
      <span class="item">A manifestation is defined as "the physical embodiment of an expression of a work",
         including, for instance, manuscripts, books, sound recordings, films, video recordings,
         CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. The manifestation represents all the physical objects
         that
         bear the same characteristics, with respect to both intellectual content and physical
         form.
      </span>
      
      <span class="label">Item</span>
      
      <span class="item">A single exemplar of a manifestation is called an item, e.g., a specific copy of a
         printed score. With manuscripts, item and manifestation levels are nearly identical.
         A
         manuscript may be regarded as a manifestation having only one item.
