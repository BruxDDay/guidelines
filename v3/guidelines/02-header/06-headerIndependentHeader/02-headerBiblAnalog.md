</h3>
Mapping elements from the MEI metadata header to another descriptive system may help
a
repository harvest selected data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record.
For this
purpose, the following attribute is provided on most meiHead elements:



<span class="specList">
   
   <span class="specDesc"></span>
   
</span>


The encoding system to which fields are mapped must be specified in **@analog**. When
possible, subfields as well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within
MARC
fields.
